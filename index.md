<img src="assets/images/stella.png" id="stella-logo">

[Stella](http://staging.stellahq.com/) is a Backbone.js/Chaplin app with a Rails 4 RESTful API. I worked on both the front- and back-end of this project during my [internship at Burnside Digital](events/2012/10/22/portland-code-school-week-one/). As part of a nine-person agile development team, I helped build out new features, wrote tests, and refactored old code. Here's [one small sample](code-samples/2013/03/02/fun-with-recursion/) of the work I did.

## Deep Cuts

### Goal Tracker
The [Goal Tracker](https://github.com/ribbitfix/goal-tracker) was my first attempt at writing a Rails app from scratch. I'm looking forward to reworking and expanding it, using everything I've learned in the last few months.

### Python/Django learning projects
I worked on the following learning projects during my informal internship at [Lo-fi Art](http://lofiart.com/):
- [Web Scraper](https://github.com/ribbitfix/web-scraper)
- [File Lending Library](https://github.com/ribbitfix/file-lending-library)
- [Requirements Extractor](https://github.com/ribbitfix/requirements-extractor)
